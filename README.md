# Quantum AI Project

## Overview

The **Quantum AI Project** aims to integrate quantum computing principles with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a **Quantum AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**. This project explores hybrid quantum-classical models, leveraging quantum algorithms for AI tasks such as optimization, decision-making, and machine learning.

### Features

- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Use quantum circuits and quantum neural networks to solve machine learning problems.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models**: Combine classical AI techniques with quantum computing for better optimization and decision-making.
- **Quantum AI API**: Expose the quantum AI models through an API for easy integration into other systems and applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Quantum Framework**: [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) – A library for quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
- **AI/ML Framework**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) – For implementing machine learning models, compatible with PennyLane for hybrid models.
- **API Development**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) – High-performance, modern web framework for building APIs.
- **Quantum Programming**: [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) – Quantum computing framework for creating quantum circuits.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub – For managing the project codebase and versioning.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. If not, follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-ai-project.git
cd quantum-ai-project
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are the core dependencies:

- `pennylane` – For quantum computing.
- `torch` – For machine learning and AI.
- `fastapi` – For building the API.
- `uvicorn` – ASGI server to run the FastAPI app.

### Running the Quantum AI Model

1. **Start the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. The FastAPI server will be running locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the documentation and interact with the API via Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
pytest
```

## API Endpoints

- **POST /quantum-ai/predict**: Use this endpoint to get predictions from the quantum AI model.
- **GET /quantum-ai/status**: Check the status of the quantum AI system.
