# Quantum-ML

## Overview

**Quantum-ML** is a cutting-edge project that combines **Quantum Computing** with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to explore hybrid quantum-classical models for solving complex machine learning tasks. By leveraging **PennyLane**, a leading quantum computing framework, this project enables the development of quantum-enhanced machine learning models that can outperform traditional approaches in areas like optimization, decision-making, and data analysis.

The uniqueness of **Quantum-ML** lies in its ability to use quantum circuits to accelerate AI tasks, offering the potential for highly scalable solutions to previously unsolvable problems. The project integrates seamlessly with classical AI models, creating a powerful hybrid system that can be applied in fields ranging from finance to healthcare.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Utilizes quantum circuits and quantum neural networks to perform machine learning tasks faster and more efficiently than classical methods.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models**: Combines classical AI techniques with quantum computing, optimizing performance and solving problems more effectively.
- **Quantum AI API**: Exposes quantum-enhanced AI models through a simple, easy-to-integrate API, allowing developers to leverage quantum capabilities in their applications.
- **Transformers Integration**: Although the core of the project uses **PennyLane**, the architecture is designed to be compatible with transformer models, allowing integration with state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Quantum Framework**: [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) – A leading library for quantum computing and quantum machine learning, which powers our quantum circuits and models.
- **AI/ML Framework**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) – Used for implementing and training classical machine learning models, providing deep integration with PennyLane for hybrid models.
- **API Development**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) – A high-performance web framework to build and expose APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Quantum Programming**: [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) again – PennyLane is used instead of Qiskit for building the quantum circuits in this project.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub – For managing project code and versioning, ensuring collaboration and contribution from the open-source community.

## Why Quantum-ML is Unique

**Quantum-ML** represents a powerful fusion of quantum computing and machine learning, setting it apart from traditional AI models:

1. **Quantum Advantage**: By utilizing quantum circuits, the project aims to accelerate certain machine learning algorithms and enable solutions to problems that classical computers struggle with.
2. **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach**: This hybrid approach allows for the best of both worlds – leveraging quantum mechanics for high-dimensional problems, while still using proven classical methods for simpler tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Quantum computing offers potential exponential scaling in certain problem domains, such as optimization, which makes Quantum-ML ideal for large-scale real-world applications.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. If not, follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subatomicERROR/quantum-ml.git
cd quantum-ml
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are the core dependencies:

- `pennylane` – For quantum computing and machine learning.
- `torch` – For machine learning and AI, used alongside PennyLane.
- `fastapi` – To build and expose the Quantum-ML API.
- `uvicorn` – ASGI server for running the FastAPI app.

### Running the Quantum AI Model

1. **Start the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. The FastAPI server will be running locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can interact with the API via Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is working, run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

## API Endpoints

- **POST /quantum-ai/predict**: This endpoint allows you to send input data to the Quantum-ML model and receive predictions using both classical and quantum-enhanced methods.
- **GET /quantum-ai/status**: Check the status of the quantum AI system and whether the server is up and running.
